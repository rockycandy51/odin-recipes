        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 cups chopped broccoli florets</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can whole straw mushrooms, drained</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) can sliced bamboo shoots, drained</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into strips</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon rice wine</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok over high heat until it begins to smoke. Stir in broccoli and fresh mushrooms, then add straw mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts. Stir-fry until broccoli is tender and all vegetables are hot, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and wipe out the wok.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the wok over high heat until it begins to smoke. Add garlic and stir-fry until it turns golden, a few seconds. Add chicken and stir-fry until browned on the edges and no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir broth, cornstarch, sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and rice wine together in a small bowl; pour over chicken in the wok and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Boil until sauce thickens and is no longer cloudy, about 30 seconds. Return vegetables to the wok; toss with sauce and cook until heated through, about 1 minute.</li>
        </ol>
